# More details on the implementation and execution of the project :
During my time in the software systems development methods course, I had the opportunity to work on a project with a team of five people that helped us gain experience in the world of server-side and client-side technologies. Our project was developed using Java, which is a reliable and scalable programming language that is widely used in software development.

To create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface, we utilized JavaFX and SceneBuilder. These tools allowed us to design the GUI efficiently and effectively. Meanwhile, on the server-side of the application, we utilized the OCSF (Object-oriented Client-Server Framework) method to communicate between the client and server. Additionally, we connected the server to a MySQL database, which allowed us to store and retrieve data from the server.

On the client-side, we utilized Java to create a seamless user experience that was both reliable and efficient. One of the key components of our implementation was the ServerMessage class, which facilitated communication between the client and server. This class was responsible for routing commands using an Enum and switch case statement, which ensured that the program knew exactly which query to make and what to return.

Overall, our project allowed us to showcase our ability to work collaboratively with a team and to develop a complex software application that utilizes multiple technologies. By utilizing Java, JavaFX, and SceneBuilder, we were able to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. Meanwhile, our use of OCSF and MySQL allowed us to develop a reliable and efficient client-server architecture. Through this project, we were able to demonstrate our skills and expertise in software development and our passion for learning and developing in the field.
